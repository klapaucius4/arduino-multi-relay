# Arduino multi relay

My version of Arduino program to control a smart home.
It based on [code](https://github.com/lkankowski/arduino-multi-relay) created by [lkankowski](https://github.com/lkankowski). I want to modify and adapt it to my private needs. For example, I want to add a control option for shutters or a garage door.
